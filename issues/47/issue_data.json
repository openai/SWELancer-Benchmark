Navigate to the Search tab.\r\n2. Press Filters from the header and select a currency (e.g., AED).\r\n3. Save the search, We navigated to the search screen, and the results correctly reflect the selected filter.\r\n4. Go back to Filters and press Reset Filters from the header.\r\n5. Press View Results, We navigated to the search results screen, and no filters are applied (all expenses are visible).\r\n6. Again, press Filters from the header and reselect the same currency as in Step 2.\r\n7. Save the search.\r\n## Expected Result:\r\nEither the currency filter on the Filters screen should not be preselected, OR The search results should display expenses filtered by the active saved filter.\r\n## Actual Result:\r\nAfter saving the search, no filters are applied to the results on the search screen, However, returning to the Filters page shows the currency filter is still selected.\r\n## Workaround:\r\nCan the user still use Expensify without this being fixed? Have you informed them of the workaround?\r\n\r\n## Platforms:\r\n<!---\r\nCheck off any platforms that are affected by this issue\r\n--->\r\nWhich of our officially supported platforms is this issue occurring on?\r\n- [ ] Android: Standalone\r\n- [ ] Android: HybridApp\r\n- [ ] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n- [ ] iOS: Standalone\r\n- [ ] iOS: HybridApp\r\n- [ ] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n- [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n- [ ] MacOS: Desktop\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/Videos\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Add any screenshot/video evidence</summary>\r\n\r\n  \r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa44246-7036-4ef3-859c-84be23e3a23e\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed102413-93fe-4cd6-bdfb-b0c688d92bc6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[View all open jobs on GitHub](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22)\r\n\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021867704716594549077</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 1867704716594549077</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2024-12-20</li>\n<li>Automatic offers: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>FitseTLT | Contributor | 105419887</li>\n</ul></li>\n    </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @johncschuster</details>",
