    "issue_repo_steps": "We originally added the ability to create as many workspaces as you want via the workspace switcher. Unfortunately this is creating confusion and duplicate workspaces, and it's ultimately a whack-a-mole situation given that we already have other workspace creation flows via Track, Global Create and Settings. \r\n\r\nAs a result, in an effort to simply this particular flow, moving forward we will limit the workspace switcher to exactly two things:\r\n\r\n1. Creating your first workspace. As a reminder, we already show an empty state to create your first workspace, as long as you're not part of any existing workspaces. (The empty state for this case looks like this). This prevents accidental duplicate creation while still promoting that you create at least one. \r\n![File](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5558d3f4-eb9a-4074-9e22-62a3e5178533)\r\n\r\n2. Focus the workspace switcher on...switching between workspaces. As a result, we'll remove the plus icon when you have one or more workspaces (highlighted in the red box below). This ensures that our multi-workspace creation flow uniformly happens via Settings, and keeps the workspace switcher focused on switching. \r\n![CleanShot 2024-11-12 at 17 15 11@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76e61cc-3f16-4d95-bbe9-f03838cb573c)\r\n\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @JmillsExpensify</details>",
