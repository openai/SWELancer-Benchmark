This issue is reproducible on both staging and prod.\n1. Sign up for a new account.\n1. On the onboarding screen, select \"Manage my team's expenses\".\n1. Select the first option: \"1-10 employees\", and click \"Continue\".\n- Notice: CreateWorkspace is called, and a workspace is created.\n1. Go back and select \"11-50 employees\", then click \"Continue\".\n- Notice: CreateWorkspace is called again, and a new workspace is created.\n\nThis behavior occurs for all employee count options, resulting in multiple workspaces being created during onboarding.\n\n## Expected Result:\nDescribe what you think should've happened\n\nWe should not create multiple workspaces, only one should be called\n\n## Actual Result:\nDescribe what actually happened\n\nwhen user goes there and back in the onboarding modal we keep creating more workspaces for them\n\n## Workaround:\nCan the user still use Expensify without this being fixed?
