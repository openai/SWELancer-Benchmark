Click `Categorize it` \r\n\r\n## Expected Result:\r\n_This is considered a feature request as it's improvements to the flow._ \r\n\r\n1. When you click `Categorize it`, if your \"default workspace\" (`activePolicyID`) is type `collect` or `control`, skip the selector and show the categories list of the default workspace. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"508\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/143742c4-d84f-44c6-a61a-37913953c8b4\">\r\n\r\n2. If you have no workspaces (or your default workspace is a personal policy), show an upgrade interstitial. When `Upgrade` is clicked, create a `collect` workspace. When `Got it, thanks` is clicked, move on to show the list of categories on the workspace created. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"860\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/999d33a0-c5f7-4b0e-aaa0-d835ca946738\">\r\n\r\n## Actual Result:\r\n1. When the user has workspaces, we show a selector to enter a name, email or phone number or create a new workspace. It's incredibly easy to go wrong here and create a second workspace, as evident in the thread. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"944\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dc3f6b9-232a-486d-a236-fa03d3b7124b\">\r\n\r\n2. When the user has no workspaces, we seem to be showing an empty state for the submit expense flow which doesn't make sense or match the action you just took to \"categorize it\" not \"submit it to someone\"\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1511\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c8508f7-023e-4cb5-8d02-94353726758a\">\r\n\r\n## Workaround:\r\nN/A \r\n\r\n## Platforms:\r\n<!---\r\nCheck off any platforms that are affected by this issue\r\n--->\r\nWhich of our officially supported platforms is this issue occurring on?\r\n- [x] Android: Standalone\r\n- [x] Android: HybridApp\r\n- [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n- [x] iOS: Standalone\r\n- [x] iOS: HybridApp\r\n- [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n- [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n- [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n\r\n## Screenshots/Videos\r\nIn-line above. \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Add any screenshot/video evidence</summary>\r\n\r\n  \r\n</details>\r\n\r\n[View all open jobs on GitHub](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22)\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021856320183270003796</li>\r\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 1856320183270003796</li>\r\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2024-11-12</li>\n<li>Automatic offers: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>nkdengineer | Contributor | 104948536</li>\n</ul></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @trjExpensify</details>",
