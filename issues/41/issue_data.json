    "issue_repo_steps": "We need to refactor the existing flow blacklisting phone numbers (see steps in screenshots). This is triggered when the user tries to sign in with a phone number that failed to receive Twilio SMS. This is a follow up to this [issue](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/52086).\n\n---\n\nWhen calling `BeginSignIn`, if `response[smsDeliveryFailureStatus]` is not `null`, then it should display the following message:\n\n```\n\"We've been unable to deliver SMS messages to [PHONE-NUMBER], so we've suspended it for 24 hours. Please try validating your number:\"\n```\n\nThere should also be a \"Validate\" button that calls `ResetSMSDeliveryFailureStatus`. \n\nIf `response[hasSMSDeliveryFailure]`is set to`true`, we should display `Validation failed because it hasn't been 24 hours since your last attempt. ${response.message}` and a \"Got it\" button that sends the user back to the beginning of the sign in flow.\n\nIf `response[hasSMSDeliveryFailure]`is set to`false`, we should display `Your number has been validated! Click below to send a new magic sign-in code.` and a \"Send\" button that calls `BeginSignIn` as usual.\n\nOnce this is complete and merged I'll do the internal QA with the BE.\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021867038175379475893</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 1867038175379475893</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2024-12-12</li>\n<li>Automatic offers: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>nyomanjyotisa | Contributor | 105327292</li>\n</ul></li>\n    </ul>\n</details>\n\n",
