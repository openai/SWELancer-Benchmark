Create a control workspace\r\n2. Enable Rules\r\n3. Enable Taxes and create couple of tax rates\r\n4. Go to categories, click on it and update the tax rate associated with category\r\n5. Go to this workspace chat, create a money request and on confirmation page, change the category\r\n\r\n## Expected Result:\r\nDescribe what you think should've happened\r\nTax rate should change to the tax rate associated with category in step 4 above\r\n\r\n## Actual Result:\r\nDescribe what actually happened\r\nTax rate does not change\r\n\r\n## Workaround:\r\nCan the user still use Expensify without this being fixed?
