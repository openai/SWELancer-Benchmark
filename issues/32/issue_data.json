Right now, users have to keep clicking exactly to the `Add to Group` button to keep adding people to the group, but if they misclick out of the button to the row, the DM is opened and the progress on group creation is lost.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nLet's update the flow such that:\r\n- Once the first group member is selected with the `Add to Group` button, the button remains, but clicking the entire row selects or deselects the user for the group (the circle with checkmark indicates the user is selected for the group)\r\n- If no user is selected, clicking the row opens/ creates a DM as it does now\r\n- if at least one user is selected for the group chat, you cannot create a DM\n<details><summary>Upwork Automation - Do Not Edit</summary>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Upwork Job URL: https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021872417451020324244</li>\n        <li>Upwork Job ID: 1872417451020324244</li>\n        <li>Last Price Increase: 2025-01-02</li>\n<li>Automatic offers: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>FitseTLT | Contributor | 105595571</li>\n</ul></li>\n    </ul>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Issue Owner</summary>Current Issue Owner: @VictoriaExpensify</details>",
